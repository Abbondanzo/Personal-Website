        <h1>Rogue</h1>
        <p>Rogue was designed as a simple one-page demo of a client-side application for the famous Counter Strike: Global Offensive game. The client wanted an effective means of showcasing the power of their application, so a full-page live video runs above the fold for every user that reaches the site.</p>
        <p>Each user that came across the page could view the primary features of the application and request a license with a simple one-click checkout. The footer kept track of the hundreds of users who had installed the application, and allowed new buyers to email their questions to the client.</p>
