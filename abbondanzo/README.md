# Personal Website Frontend

The current entirety of my personal website (in progress/under construction). This site is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Since the current site-in-progress is more of an experiment than a working webpage, proper edits to this Readme will be added in the future.

## Env Information

Inside the `static` folder, there is an `.env.example` file. This must be _copied_ and named as `.env` with your correct Google Analytics tracking IDs. Even if you have no IDs, you should still perform this test or Webpack will fail to build.

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn lint
```
