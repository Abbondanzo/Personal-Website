                <span class="underscore-pls"></span>
                <p>Originally designed and developed for our student-led organization Sthacks. This webpage was modeled after a standard terminal window and allows users to fully interact by typing various commands.</p>

                <p>The website also includes a multitude of features, such as the ability to minimize and maximize the window. Aside from exploring information about Sthacks, users can also hunt for little easter eggs planted in the terminal. Everything was designed in Photoshop before getting developed in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/jQuery, and Python.</p>
