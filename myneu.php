                <p>Modern MyNEU is a fully functional Google Chrome extension, available in the webstore, that completely redesigns Northeastern University's outdated and ill-designed MyNEU portal.</p>

                <p>Large amounts of features and reimplementations of the old site have been added to the extension. A freshly designed login portal allows users to take advantage of password storage apps where the old site would prevent. A search bar that narrows down specific widgets within the portal has also been added. Users can now minimize and maximize menus and widgets individually.</p>

                <p>Since the plugin is still in beta stages, new features are getting added that will allow users to customize layouts and themes from within the options pop-out. Everything down to the individual colors of elements and the ability to export custom preferences will give users the full control they desire from MyNEU.</p>
