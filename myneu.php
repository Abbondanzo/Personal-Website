                <p>Modern MyNEU is a fully functional Google Chrome extension available in the webstore that completely redesigns Northeastern University's MyNEU portal. The portal was last updated visually in 2009 and has not been exposed to modern design preferences.</p>

                <p>Large amounts of features and reimplementations of the old site have been added to the extension. A freshly designed login portal allows users to take advantage of password storage apps where the old site would prevent. A search bar that narrows down specific widgets within the portal has also been added. Users can now minimize and maximize menus and widgets individually.</p>

                <p>Since the plugin is still in beta stages, new features are getting added that will allow users to customize layouts and themes from within the options pop-out. Everything down to the individual colors of elements and the ability to export custom preferences will give users the full control they desire from MyNEU.</p>
