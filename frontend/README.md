# Personal Website

The current entirety of my personal website (in progress/under construction). This site is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Since the current site-in-progress is more of an experiment than a working webpage, proper edits to this Readme will be added in the future.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build --report
```
