                <p>Flipster came to be when I was contacted by a client out in Australia looking to innovate the trading market. I was tasked with creating page-by-page mockups from the landing screen to the confirmation of a trade. </p>

            </left><right class="lr-content">
                <p>In order to design the concepts, I utilized Adobeâ€™s Photoshop and Illustrator to deliver what the client was looking for. Photoshop allowed me to make small tweaks without having to change code. Illustrator gave  me the power to design various visual elements from mockups to the logo itself.</p>
