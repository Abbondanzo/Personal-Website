# Personal Website
The current entirety of my personal website (in progress/under construction). I have included everything relevant, but have ignored CSS/CSS maps. SCSS is fine enough.

## Compiling
This website uses [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install). In order to get it running on your device, you must compile all `.scss` files before trying to render the page.
