# Personal Website
The current entirety of my personal website (in progress/under construction). This site is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). Since the current site-in-progress is more of an experiment than a working webpage, proper edits to this Readme will be added in the future.

## Compiling

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# compiles all files down to /public folder
npm run dev

# serves on localhost:8000 with hot reloading thanks to browserSync
npm run watch

# build for production with minification
npm run production
```
